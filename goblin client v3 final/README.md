#Goblins-Dice-Client-kivy

Simple client for Goblins Dice Server

Written in Kivy. Tested on Windows x64 and Ubuntu 20

It does not work properly on the Android platform. The problem is with the Twisted module. I described it here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63888791/strange-twisted-client-behavior-in-kivy-android-app
